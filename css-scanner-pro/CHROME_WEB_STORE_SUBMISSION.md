# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-11-16

CSS Scanner Pro respects your privacy. This extension is designed to inspect and display CSS and HTML directly in your browser without collecting, storing, or transmitting any personal data.

## Data Collection

**CSS Scanner Pro does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.**

- No browsing history is collected  
- No user data is stored on servers  
- No data is shared with third parties  
- No analytics or tracking tools are used  
- No cookies are used  
- No account or login is required  

## What the Extension Accesses

The extension needs limited access to webpage content solely to display CSS and HTML of the element you hover over.

The extension **does not modify pages**, **does not monitor navigation**, and **does not extract content beyond what is necessary for inspection**.

### The extension may temporarily read:
- CSS rules applied to the hovered element  
- HTML structure of the selected element  
- Computed styles displayed in the inspector UI  

This information is processed **locally** in your browser and is **never sent anywhere**.

## Data Storage

**CSS Scanner Pro stores nothing externally.**  
User settings (such as preferences, toggles, and UI options) are saved **locally** using Chrome’s built-in storage. This information never leaves your device.

## Permissions Explanation

CSS Scanner Pro uses the following Chrome permissions:

### `activeTab`
Used to read CSS and HTML **only while the user is actively interacting** with the extension.

### `storage`
Used to save optional settings (theme, editor preferences, shortcuts, etc.) **on the user’s device**.

### `scripting`
Used to safely inject the inspector overlay. Scripts run **only on demand** when activated by the user.

The extension **never** runs on all sites by default.

## Children’s Privacy

This extension is suitable for all ages and does not collect data from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If the privacy policy changes, the updated version will be published in this repository and included in the extension submission.
